# China-Undergraduate-Mathematical-Contest-in-Modeling

Hi! This is our project in the China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling. We tackled problems regrading analysis and study on chemical constituents of ancient glass products.

In problem 1, we conducted Chi-square test and applied Kendall correlation coefficient to analyze the relationship between the surface weathering of these glass artifacts and their glass type, patterns, and colors. In combination with the glass type, examine the statistical patterns of chemical composition related to weathering on the surface of the artifacts,, as well as constructing an relational model to 
In problem 2, we built a random forest classification model to predict , and employed Kmeans to
