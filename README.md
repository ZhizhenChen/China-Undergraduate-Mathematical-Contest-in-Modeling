# China-Undergraduate-Mathematical-Contest-in-Modeling

Hi! This is our project in the China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling. We tackled problems regarding the analysis and study of chemical constituents of ancient glass products.

In problem 1, we conducted a Chi-square test and applied the Kendall correlation coefficient to analyze the relationship between the surface weathering of these glass artifacts with other features and constructed a relational model to predict the glasses' chemical composition before weathered.

In problem 2, we built a random forest classification model to classify different types of glasses and employed Kmeans to classify sub-types.

In problem 3, we analyzed the model's sensitivity and robustness using Andrew's curve.
